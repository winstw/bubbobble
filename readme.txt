To compile the Bubble Bobble game, you simply need to go into the "game/src" folder into 
a console,
and run "make".
Go back to the main "game" folder. 
If everything is all right,  a "bubbob" executable has been created in the main game 
folder.
To launch the game, get in the main "game" folder and run it with "./bubbob".
